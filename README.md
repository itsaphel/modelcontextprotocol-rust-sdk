# modelcontextprotocol-rust-sdk

This is a fork of Anthropic's [MCP Rust SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk) repo.

I'm experimenting with what the developer ergonomics are like, using a Rust SDK to build MCP servers. Will experiment with different ways of building and exposing tools, and building servers.
